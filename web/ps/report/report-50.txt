The bank was absolved of responsibility in a 2007 enquiry.\r\nThe end of his leadership period was brought about by another crisis much bigger than the bank itself: in 2007, the collapse of the US subprime mortgage market revealed huge liabilities in UBS\u2019 portfolios, amounting to some CHF20 billion ($20.6 billion) in losses.\r\nAs a result of this, the bank was forced to raise almost CHF10 billion in new capital, and shareholders gave their backing to the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund taking a 10% stake in the bank. UBS also approached the Swiss government for help, and ended up transferring CHF39 billion in bad assets to the Swiss National Bank.\r\nThe crisis cost Ospel his job; he was replaced by Peter Kurer in April 2008.\r\nThroughout his career, Ospel was also frequently scrutinized for his astronomical salary, which reached some CHF24 million in 2006, 300 times more than the average salary of a standard UBS worker. His decamping from Basel to the low-tax canton of Schwyz also didn\u2019t help his public image.\r\nOspel is survived by his wife and two children. He also had two children with two previous wives.","bibliography":"","length":294,"length_raw":294,"created":1588791668,"modified":1588791820,"notified":0,"status":2,"filter_chars":0,"filter_references":0,"filter_quotes":0,"filter_wrong_text":0,"language":"en","plagiat":100,"search_web":1,"search_web_api":0,"search_files":0,"search_files_filter":null,"search_files_api":0,"search_files_api_filter":null,"progress":1,"type":1,"search_storage":0,"search_storage_filter":null,"storage_id":null,"similarity":100,"originality":0,"status_ex":"checked","file":"https:\/\/plagiarismsearch.com\/reports\/download\/2165853.html?key=48227e2ec350a63de01f6c9e391700b2","files":[{"url":"https:\/\/plagiarismsearch.com\/r\/download\/2165853.html?key=48227e2ec350a63de01f6c9e391700b2","type":"application\/pdf","language":"en","version":3},{"url":"https:\/\/plagiarismsearch.com\/es\/r\/download\/2165853.html?key=48227e2ec350a63de01f6c9e391700b2","type":"application\/pdf","language":"es","version":3},{"url":"https:\/\/plagiarismsearch.com\/pl\/r\/download\/2165853.html?key=48227e2ec350a63de01f6c9e391700b2","type":"application\/pdf","language":"pl","version":3},{"url":"https:\/\/plagiarismsearch.com\/reports\/download\/2165853.html?key=48227e2ec350a63de01f6c9e391700b2","type":"application\/pdf","language":"en","version":1}]},"version":"3.0.0"}
