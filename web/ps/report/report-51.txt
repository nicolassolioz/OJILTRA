Only the most heartwarming responses from you - the best audience on the planet - still keep us going and we plan to do everything to keep this ship sailing the positive vibes forever.\r\n??2021 lineup:\r\nWe\u2019re working closely with all bands to mirror this amazing lineup to 2021 in full. So far we have nothing but positive responses from all bands involved and we plan to put even some cherries on top.\r\n??Tickets:\r\nAll tickets bought for the 2020 edition will automatically remain valid for 2021. You don\u2019t have to swap your ticket or anything. It keeps all of us precious time and energy. Just keep it as a steady investment for our reunion in August 2021.\r\n??Ticket swap:\r\nIf you really can\u2019t join us on the new dates in 2021, we teamed up with TicketSwap to become the official tickets reselling platform that guarantees a secure transaction.
