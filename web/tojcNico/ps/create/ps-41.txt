As of Thursday, April 30th, visitation will again be allowed in Zurich nursing homes, provided protective health measures have been adopted.\r\nOtherwise known as \u2018visitor zones\u2019, the visitation boxes allow communication via phone or speakers while preventing transmission through a sheet of plexiglass or glass.\r\nPeople over the age of 65 are at a much higher risk of becoming severely sick or dying from the virus.\r\nAccording to research conducted by The Local Switzerland earlier in April, the median age of dying from the virus in Switzerland is 83.\r\nWhat we know about the victims of the coronavirus pandemic in Switzerland\r\nOnly 35 of the more than 1700 deaths in Switzerland have been among people younger than 60.\r\nIn Zurich, 60 percent of the total deaths from the virus have come among nursing home residents.","bibliography":"","length":268,"length_raw":268,"created":1588791658,"modified":1588791658,"notified":0,"status":-9,"filter_chars":0,"filter_references":0,"filter_quotes":0,"filter_wrong_text":0,"language":"en","plagiat":null,"search_web":1,"search_web_api":0,"search_files":0,"search_files_filter":null,"search_files_api":0,"search_files_api_filter":null,"progress":0,"search_storage":0,"search_storage_filter":null,"storage_id":null,"similarity":null,"originality":null,"status_ex":"init","file":null,"files":null},"version":"3.0.0"}
