Only 14 percent said they would definitely or probably not use the app, while 16 percent said they hadn\u2019t made up their mind.\r\nAlthough the details of the app have as yet not been finalised, it is expected to be introduced on a voluntary basis.\r\nThis is how Switzerland\u2019s contact tracing app will work\r\nAccording to research by Oxford University, contact tracing apps need a minimum of 60 percent of the population to use them in order to be effective.\r\nContact tracing apps have been successful in preventing the spread of Covid-19, primarily in Asia, however their introduction across Europe has been delayed primarily due to privacy concerns.\r\nAlmost three quarters (73 percent) said they would use the app due to a sense of responsibility towards the general public, while two-thirds (67 percent) wanted to protect family and friends.\r\nMore than half of those surveyed said protecting the most vulnerable was a motivating factor.\r\nJust under a third of those surveyed were concerned the app would make their phones easier to hack, while 40 percent were worried about false alarms.","bibliography":"","length":233,"length_raw":233,"created":1588791659,"modified":1588791659,"notified":0,"status":-9,"filter_chars":0,"filter_references":0,"filter_quotes":0,"filter_wrong_text":0,"language":"en","plagiat":null,"search_web":1,"search_web_api":0,"search_files":0,"search_files_filter":null,"search_files_api":0,"search_files_api_filter":null,"progress":0,"search_storage":0,"search_storage_filter":null,"storage_id":null,"similarity":null,"originality":null,"status_ex":"init","file":null,"files":null},"version":"3.0.0"}
