Swiss in favour of coronavirus tracing app despite privacy concerns
While also expressing concerns about privacy and security, the majority of Swiss citizens have indicated they would use a contact tracing app.
One third of those surveyed said they would definitely use the app, while a further 35 percent said they probably would. Only 14 percent said they would definitely or probably not use the app, while 16 percent said they hadn’t made up their mind. 
Although the details of the app have as yet not been finalised, it is expected to be introduced on a voluntary basis. 
This is how Switzerland’s contact tracing app will work
According to research by Oxford University, contact tracing apps need a minimum of 60 percent of the population to use them in order to be effective. 
Contact tracing apps have been successful in preventing the spread of Covid-19, primarily in Asia, however their introduction across Europe has been delayed primarily due to privacy concerns. 
Almost three quarters (73 percent) said they would use the app due to a sense of responsibility towards the general public, while two-thirds (67 percent) wanted to protect family and friends.
More than half of those surveyed said protecting the most vulnerable was a motivating factor. 
Just under a third of those surveyed were concerned the app would make their phones easier to hack, while 40 percent were worried about false alarms.
